# PNȚ Mod

![](https://i.imgur.com/ZqHzFM1.png)

Introduction
============

Romanians learn at history about the two great "historical parties": PNL (Partidul Național Liberal/National Liberal Party) and PNȚ (Partidul Național-Țărănesc/ National Peasants' Party). PNȚ was a conservative party, pro-monarchy. Also, agrarianist and traditionalist are two keywords that describe the party well. Its leader, 
Iuliu Maniu, was against political compromise, believing in moral values and the supremacy of democracy.

Even though PNȚ was one of Romania's most important parties, it is not featured in Hearts of Iron IV, most probably because it wasn't in power during WW2. I propose an ahistorical scenario, starting in 1936, where you have the possibility of electing PNȚ before the war, focusing on developing the industry of Romania and preparing the country for the unavoidable war.
